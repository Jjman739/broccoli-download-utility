# broccoli-download-utility
Sorry if you're actually looking for a tool. There is one, technically, but I guarantee it doesn't satisfy your use case. The "download utility" is a coverup (but nothing fishy, I assure you.) The actual repository is somewhat more hidden, for the purposes of not spoiling something to a certain group of my friends. If I know you from the internet, you might be in that group, so please do not go digging. It's no fun that way.

If you don't know me, feel free to go digging if you're curious, but what you find will be fairly meaningless to you. Apologies for the false front.
